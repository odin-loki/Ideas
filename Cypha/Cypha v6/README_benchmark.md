# __1\. What Is This File?__

benchmark\.py is the final step in the pipeline\. It trains Cypha on each of the nine datasets produced by convert\.py, evaluates accuracy on a held\-out test split, and saves results to benchmark\_state\.json\.

Its most important design constraint is that it never loads a full dataset into RAM\. A 2 GB speech\_commands\.txt file trains and evaluates on a machine with 512 MB of free RAM\. This is achieved through byte\-offset streaming: the file is indexed once \(storing only the byte position of each line\), then individual lines are sought and read on demand\.

__Where this sits in the pipeline__

download\.py  →  convert\.py  →  benchmark\.py
Reads the 9 wire\-format \.txt files from convert\.py\. Writes benchmark\_state\.json and benchmark\_report\.json\. Saves per\-dataset checkpoints to \./checkpoints/\.

python benchmark\.py            \# run full benchmark \(all 9 datasets\)

python benchmark\.py \-\-status   \# show results without re\-running

python benchmark\.py \-\-reset    \# clear state \(optionally clear checkpoints\)

# __2\. Byte\-Offset Streaming__

This is the core technical idea that makes benchmark\.py work on large files\. Read this section carefully — everything else depends on it\.

## __2\.1 The Problem with Large Files__

A naive training loop would do this:

\# NAIVE — loads everything into RAM

with open\("panoradio\_rf\.txt"\) as f:

    lines = f\.readlines\(\)        \# 2 GB → 2 GB in RAM

random\.shuffle\(lines\)            \# shuffle in RAM

for line in lines:               \# iterate

    inp, label = line\.split\("|||"\)

    cypha\.train\_step\(inp, label\)

For panoradio\_rf\.txt at ~2 GB and speech\_commands\.txt at ~1\.5 GB, this immediately runs out of RAM on most machines\. And you cannot shuffle a file without reading it first — so you cannot do stochastic training without loading it\.

## __2\.2 The Solution: Index First, Seek Later__

The \_build\_offset\_index\(\) function from Cypha\.py solves this in one pass:

\# \_build\_offset\_index\(filepath\) — runs ONCE at benchmark start

offsets = \[\]

with open\(filepath, "rb"\) as f:

    pos = 0

    for line in f:

        if b"|||" in line:

            offsets\.append\(pos\)    \# store byte position, not the line

        pos \+= len\(line\)

return np\.array\(offsets, dtype=np\.uint64\)   \# ~8 bytes per line

The result is an array of uint64 values — one 8\-byte number per training sample\. For a 400k\-sample RF file this is 400k × 8 = 3\.2 MB, regardless of how large the actual samples are\. The samples themselves are never held in memory\.

Training then works by shuffling the offset array \(a 3\.2 MB shuffle, not a 2 GB shuffle\) and seeking to each position:

\# Training loop — O\(1\) RAM per sample

shuffled = rng\.permutation\(train\_offsets\)   \# shuffle the 3\.2 MB index

with open\(filepath, "rb"\) as fh:

    for offset in shuffled:

        fh\.seek\(offset\)                     \# seek to byte position

        line = fh\.readline\(\)                \# read exactly one line

        inp, label = line\.split\(b"|||"\)     \# parse

        cypha\.train\_step\(inp\.decode\(\), label\.decode\(\)\)

__Memory cost at scale__

A 400,000\-sample RF dataset requires 3\.2 MB for the offset index \+ a few MB for the Cypha model = under 50 MB total RAM\. The 2 GB file lives on disk and is accessed one line at a time via OS\-level seek/read, which is POSIX\-standard and works on any filesystem\.

# __3\. Train/Test Split__

The split is performed entirely on the offset array — no file reading required:

  split\_idx      =  floor\(n\_offsets × 0\.80\)

  train\_offsets  =  offsets\[ : split\_idx \]

  test\_offsets   =  offsets\[ split\_idx : \]

The first 80% of lines \(by file position\) form the training set; the last 20% form the test set\. This preserves any temporal ordering in the data — important for network\_intrusion \(NSL\-KDD\), where later samples may include attack types the model has not seen yet, simulating real deployment conditions\.

No stratification is applied\. For heavily imbalanced datasets, this means the test set class distribution matches the dataset's natural class distribution, which is the correct evaluation setting for a production system\.

# __4\. Checkpointing and Resume__

Training a full dataset takes time — network\_intrusion at 126k samples runs for ~10 minutes\. benchmark\.py saves a checkpoint after every epoch so you can stop and resume without losing work\.

## __4\.1 Checkpoint Location__

Per\-dataset checkpoints are saved in \./checkpoints/<dataset\_name>/\. Each checkpoint consists of two files:

- meta\.json: epochs\_completed, n\_anchors, step, temperature, timestamp
- anchors\.npz: all anchor vectors \(keys, vectors, labels\) as compressed NumPy arrays

\./checkpoints/

  sql\_injection/

    meta\.json         \# \{"epochs\_completed": 1, "n\_anchors": 247, \.\.\.\}

    anchors\.npz       \# np\.savez\_compressed with keys, vecs, labels

  network\_intrusion/

    meta\.json

    anchors\.npz

  \.\.\.

## __4\.2 Resume Logic__

At the start of each dataset's benchmark, benchmark\.py calls cypha\.get\_checkpoint\_info\(dataset\_name\)\. If a checkpoint exists and epochs\_completed >= target\_epochs, the checkpoint is loaded and training is skipped entirely — only evaluation runs:

ckpt = cypha\.get\_checkpoint\_info\(dataset\_name\)

if ckpt and ckpt\["epochs\_completed"\] >= epochs:

    \# Already trained — just load and evaluate

    cypha\.\_load\_checkpoint\(dataset\_name\)

    print\(f"  Loaded \{cypha\.memory\.n:,\} anchors"\)

else:

    \# Train from \(possibly partial\) checkpoint

    cypha\.train\_file\_stateful\_offsets\(

        filepath, train\_offsets, dataset\_name, epochs=epochs

    \)

__The checkpoint\-load bug \(fixed\)__

An earlier version of benchmark\.py skipped \_load\_checkpoint\(\) when the checkpoint was already complete, then immediately evaluated — against an empty AnchorMemory that had just been constructed\. This caused 0% accuracy on every re\-run \(the model predicted "\[no memory\]" for every sample\)\. The fix: always call \_load\_checkpoint\(\) before evaluating, even when training is skipped\. The state JSON detects this by checking whether errors include "\[no memory\]" and re\-runs those datasets automatically\.

# __5\. Evaluation__

## __5\.1 Streaming Evaluation__

evaluate\_accuracy\(\) uses the same byte\-offset approach as training\. It never loads the test set into RAM:

with open\(filepath, "rb"\) as fh:

    for offset in eval\_offsets:

        pair = \_read\_at\_offset\(fh, offset\)   \# seek \+ readline \+ parse

        inp, expected = pair

        result, conf = cypha\.infer\(inp, verbose=False\)

        if result == expected: correct \+= 1

## __5\.2 Evenly\-Spaced Sampling__

If the test set has more samples than test\_sample \(default 1,000\), the evaluator takes an evenly\-spaced subset:

  step     =  n\_test / sample\_size

  indices  =  \{ floor\(i × step\)  |  i = 0, 1, …, sample\_size−1 \}

This is deterministic — the same indices are selected on every run\. It ensures the sample covers the full test set distribution rather than only its first 1,000 lines, which would be biased toward the beginning of the file\.

## __5\.3 Error Recording__

Up to 10 misclassified samples are stored in the results dict for diagnosis\. Each error record contains:

- input: first 50 characters of the input string
- expected: the true label
- got: what Cypha predicted
- confidence: the confidence score of the wrong prediction

These appear in the benchmark output and are saved to benchmark\_state\.json for later inspection\. High\-confidence wrong predictions \(conf > 0\.8\) indicate the model has learned a prototype that genuinely overlaps with the wrong class — these are structurally ambiguous inputs, not random mistakes\.

# __6\. Full Execution Flow__

Here is the complete sequence for a single dataset from start to finish:

benchmark\_dataset\(cypha, "sql\_injection", "sql\_injection\.txt", epochs=1\)

1\. Check if file exists\. If not, return None \(skip silently\)\.

2\. \_build\_offset\_index\("sql\_injection\.txt"\)

   → Scan file, record byte position of every "|||" line\.

   → Result: offsets array, ~8 bytes/line, ~240 KB for 30k samples\.

   → Time: ~0\.3 s for a 2 MB file\.

3\. Split:

   train\_offsets = offsets\[:24000\]   \# first 80%

   test\_offsets  = offsets\[24000:\]   \# last 20%

4\. get\_checkpoint\_info\("sql\_injection"\)

   → If checkpoint exists with epochs\_completed >= 1: load it, skip to step 6\.

   → Else: proceed to step 5\.

5\. train\_file\_stateful\_offsets\(filepath, train\_offsets, "sql\_injection", epochs=1\)

   → Shuffle train\_offsets\.

   → For each offset: seek → readline → train\_step\(inp, label\)\.

   → After each epoch: save checkpoint to \./checkpoints/sql\_injection/\.

6\. evaluate\_accuracy\(cypha, filepath, test\_offsets, sample\_size=1000\)

   → Take 1000 evenly\-spaced samples from test\_offsets\.

   → For each: seek → readline → infer\(inp\) → compare to expected\.

   → Return \(accuracy, correct, total, errors\)\.

7\. Return results dict\. Saved to benchmark\_state\.json\.

# __7\. The State File__

benchmark\_state\.json is the output of the run\. It accumulates results across all datasets and is updated after each one completes\. Safe to inspect while the benchmark is running\.

# __8\. Cypha Configuration__

benchmark\.py initialises Cypha with production settings:

cypha = CyphaStateful\(feature\_dim=4096, resonance\_dim=256\)

feature\_dim=4096 is used for the full benchmark \(vs 512 in the synthetic benchmark\)\. This increases the Omega embedding dimension, giving more resolution for the hash embedding\. The JL bound for classification quality is set by resonance\_dim=256, not feature\_dim, so raising feature\_dim does not change the mathematical guarantees — it just reduces hash collisions in the feature vector\.

# __11\. Troubleshooting__

## __11\.1  "Missing N converted files — Run: python convert\.py"__

benchmark\.py checks that all 9 \.txt files exist before starting\. If any are missing, it lists them and exits\. Run convert\.py first \(or for a quick test, run synthetic\_benchmark\.py which needs no files\)\.

## __11\.2  Accuracy shows 0% with all errors "\[no memory\]"__

This is the checkpoint\-load bug\. It happens when the benchmark\_state\.json shows a dataset as completed with 0% accuracy and every error entry says "got: \[no memory\]"\. This means evaluation ran against an empty AnchorMemory\. The current version of benchmark\.py detects this pattern and automatically re\-runs the affected dataset\. If it persists, delete the entry from benchmark\_state\.json manually and re\-run\.

## __11\.3  Training is slow on panoradio\_rf__

Each RF sample is ~16 KB of hex text\. The IQ encoder does a 512\-point STFT, which costs ~1\.6 ms per sample\. At 320k training samples this is ~8 minutes of encoding time alone\. This is expected — it matches the profiling results documented in Cypha\.py\. The benchmark runs each dataset sequentially, so the RF dataset does not block the text datasets\.

## __11\.4  Interrupted benchmark — how to resume__

Just run python benchmark\.py again\. The state file records which datasets have completed results\. Only datasets without a valid \(non\-zero, non\-\[no memory\]\) result will be re\-run\. Checkpoints are loaded so training resumes from where it stopped within any partially\-trained dataset\.

End of benchmark\.py reference\.  Next: synthetic\_benchmark\.py
