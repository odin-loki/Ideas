# Roadmap — reference → profiled → GPU experiments → native port

The **Python tree** is the spec: tests, parity blobs, fixture generators. The **product hot path** is in C++/Qt. Python stays for research and golden output generation.

---

## Where we are (current)

**All milestones M1–M6 are complete.** The full native stack is built and CI-gated:

| Block | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Inference kernel (encode + LLR + GH + softmax) | ✅ parity vs `expected.npz` |
| Registry + preprocessor contract (fit, transform, CSV load) | ✅ parity fixtures |
| Online `train_step` (DIF, GH, replay, NIG, context, OOD) | ✅ parity fixtures |
| Regression stack (MKE/RFF/two-stage/ridge/EMA) | ✅ parity fixtures |
| `cypha_rest` native server | ✅ JSON-compatible with FastAPI reference |
| Qt shell (`cypha_qt_shell`) | ✅ full training/inference/registry/plots/experiments UI |
| Preprocessor fit from Qt (scale + PCA, no Python) | ✅ `fit_from_design_matrix` + save `preprocessor.json` |
| Dataset panel (column picker, preview, val split) | ✅ |
| Experiments DB (SQLite, M6) | ✅ `experiment_db_crud`, Qt M6 panel |
| Deterministic REST replay (`/session/rng`) | ✅ cross-runtime state transfer |
| Autoregressive / generation path | ✅ native `generation_parity`, CTest |
| Test suite | ✅ 33 CTests + ~189 pytest (WSL + Windows); `native_cuda_bench` skipped without CUDA GPU |

---

## Phase 0 — Debugging baseline ✅

- `Cypha.py` core: 54 deterministic checks + parity fixtures.
- Studio pipeline: 48 checks + pytest API smoke.
- Benchmark + sklearn CV as regression smoke.

---

## Phase 1 — Locking behaviour before native ✅

All tests committed and green:

- `InferenceEngine` vs raw `CyphaDIF.infer` — same label + conf.
- `score_matrix(..., use_field=True/False)` — finite LLR, consistent shapes.
- Preprocessor + trainer edge cases.

---

## Phase 2 — Profile on real data (CPU) ✅

Profiling infrastructure complete:

- `python scripts/profile_real_datasets.py` — sklearn tabular; cumtime identifies GEMM, RFF, NIG bottlenecks.
- `scripts/gpu_microbench.py` + `scripts/gpu_fullbench.py` — CuPy/CPU timing for encode+LLR+softmax+gate.

---

## Phase 3 — GPU (Python accel path) ✅

`cypha_accel` provides CuPy-accelerated `fused_score_llr`, `project_features`, `softmax_rows_llr` — CPU NumPy fallback when CuPy is absent. GPU microbench and full pipeline bench are scripted.

Native **`cypha::accel`**: optional **CUDA** (`native/src/accel_cuda.cu`, `-DCYPHA_ENABLE_CUDA=ON`) or **parallel CPU** (`std::thread` in `accel_backend.cpp`). CI builds without CUDA; **`cuda_smoke`** still passes on CPU threads.

---

## Phase 4 — Native port (M1–M6) ✅

All milestones complete — see [`PORT_FULL_STACK.md`](../port/PORT_FULL_STACK.md) for the full per-milestone record.

---

## Phase 5 — Current engineering horizon

The native hot path is complete. The next priorities are about depth and distribution:

1. **CUDA in CI (optional)** — add a matrix job with NVIDIA runner + `-DCYPHA_ENABLE_CUDA=ON` to exercise `cuda_smoke --bench`. See [`docs/FUTURE.md`](../FUTURE.md) §1.

2. **Qt shell polish** — streaming progress updates during long CSV training, chart zoom/pan, optional dark theme, export to ONNX. See [`docs/FUTURE.md`](../FUTURE.md) §2.

3. **Packaged binary** — single-binary Qt shell (static Qt + `cypha_core`) with no runtime dependencies; Windows `.msi` / Linux AppImage. See [`docs/FUTURE.md`](../FUTURE.md) §3.

4. **Web UI** — lightweight REST front-end replacing PySide6 for headless server deployments. See [`docs/FUTURE.md`](../FUTURE.md) §4.

5. **Multi-model serving** — `cypha_rest` serving N models in parallel; hot-swap without restart. See [`docs/FUTURE.md`](../FUTURE.md) §5.
