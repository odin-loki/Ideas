Unpublished Technical Report — 2026

__Abstract__

We apply harmonic analysis to the CyphaDIF classifier’s encoder, parser, and class representations across ten probes\. The encoder matrix W is treated as a linear filter with a measurable transfer function; the class offset vectors δ\_k as discrete signals; the centroid graph as a domain for a graph Fourier transform; and the sequence of encoder outputs per class as a multivariate time series\. Key findings: __\(1\)__ The encoder W has a mild 1/f⁰·² spectral decay \(power\-law slope −0\.20\) across its 128 singular modes, effective rank 113\.8 \(near\-full\), and condition number 13\.27\. The singular spectrum is nearly flat \(spectral flatness 0\.965\), indicating W acts as a near\-white filter rather than a selective frequency amplifier\. __\(2\)__ Encoder rows concentrate power in the mid\-to\-high frequency band \(CoM = 31/64, 64\.8% of rows mid\-dominated, HF fraction 0\.50\)\. The encoder is a high\-pass filter relative to index space: it suppresses slowly\-varying index patterns and amplifies rapidly oscillating ones\. The input–output gain ratio G\(high\)/G\(low\) = 44\.3×, confirming strong high\-pass behaviour\. __\(3\)__ The Gram matrix of all 1,000 encoder outputs has effective dimension 1\.24, with a single dominant eigenvalue capturing 89\.7% of variance and a spectral gap of 0\.960\. Per\-class Gram matrices have effective rank ≈1\.00–1\.06: each class’s encoder outputs lie essentially on a ray through the origin, a consequence of the near\-deterministic encoding of structured inputs\. __\(4\)__ The class offset vectors δ\_k have broadly distributed harmonic content \(flatness 0\.78–0\.90\) with peak frequencies scattered across \[8, 52\]\. bin\_malware has the highest total power \(2\.52\), consistent with its diffuse, high\-variance latent distribution\. Pairwise harmonic similarity averages 0\.799: class offset spectra are moderately but not identically shaped\. __\(5\)__ The graph Laplacian of the K=10 centroid graph has Fiedler value λ₁ = 4\.85 \(large algebraic connectivity, meaning the centroid graph is well\-connected\)\. The graph Fourier transform of the self\-LLR signal concentrates 90\.4% of power in mode 0 \(the DC component\), confirming that LLR values are smooth on the class graph — nearby classes have similar self\-LLR values\. __\(6\)__ All 10 class output sequences have near\-identical spectral fingerprints \(cosine similarity ≥ 0\.9999\), meaning the encoder maps all traffic classes to the same power distribution over frequency\. The LLR sequences are high\-SNR \(SNR up to 7\.5×10⁶ for log classes\) with near\-flat AC spectra, confirming that within\-class LLR variation is spectrally white\.

# __1\. Introduction__

Harmonic analysis provides a frequency\-domain characterisation of the CyphaDIF pipeline that complements the spatial \(Euclidean, topological\) analyses of previous papers\. By treating the encoder matrix W as a linear filter, the class offset vectors δ\_k as discrete signals indexed by dimension, the encoder output sequences as time series, and the centroid graph as a signal domain, we obtain a multi\-scale spectral picture of what the classifier has learned\.

Six distinct spectral objects are analysed: the singular value spectrum of W \(Section 2\), the frequency content of W’s rows and columns \(Section 3\), the eigenspectrum of the Gram matrix \(Section 4\), the power spectral density of encoder output sequences \(Section 5\), the harmonic content of the class offset vectors δ\_k \(Section 6\), and the graph Fourier transform of the LLR signal on the centroid graph \(Section 8\)\. Together these reveal the frequency\-domain fingerprint of the learned representation\.

# __2\. Encoder Transfer Function: SVD Analysis__

## __2\.1 Singular Value Spectrum__

The encoder matrix W ∈ ℝ^\{128×128\} maps feature vectors f to latent representations h = Wf\. In the frequency\-domain language, the singular values σ\_i of W are the “gains” of the encoder along its principal modes\. The singular value decomposition W = UΣVᵀ decomposes the encoder into input modes \(rows of Vᵀ\), amplitudes \(Σ\), and output modes \(columns of U\)\.

__Key result__

__The encoder is a near\-full\-rank, near\-white\-noise filter with mild 1/f spectral decay\. __The effective rank of 113\.8 out of 128 \(88\.9%\) confirms that W is almost a bijection in terms of information capacity\. The spectral flatness of 0\.965 \(close to the maximum of 1\.0\) means the singular values are nearly uniform, with no single mode dominating\. The power\-law slope −0\.20 is much flatter than the −1/f slope of 1/f noise \(slope −1\) or the −2 slope of Brownian motion, placing the encoder’s spectral character between white and pink noise in the dimension\-mode domain\.

__Cumulative power in top\-k singular modes is broadly distributed\. __The top\-1 mode captures only 9\.83% of total power, the top\-8 capture 28\.3%, and 64 modes are needed to reach 64\.2%\. This broad distribution is consistent with the high effective rank: no small subset of modes dominates the encoder\. By contrast, a low\-rank encoder would have ≥90% of power in the first few modes\. CyphaDIF’s W is high\-rank by design, preserving information from all 128 feature dimensions equally\.

## __2\.2 Coupling Between Singular Modes and Variance Precision__

The right singular vectors v\_i \(rows of Vᵀ\) define the input directions probed by each singular mode\. We compute the precision\-weighted norm of each v\_i: Π\_i = Σ\_d |v\_\{i,d\}|² / v\_\{0,d\}, which measures how much the mode concentrates weight in high\-precision \(low\-variance\) dimensions\.

__Pearson r\(σ\_i, Π\_i\) = 0\.193: weak positive coupling\. __The dominant singular mode \(mode 1, σ = 1\.697\) also has the highest precision weight \(Π = 123\.6\), suggesting the encoder’s principal amplification direction is aligned with high\-precision input dimensions\. However, the overall correlation is weak \(r = 0\.193\), meaning the singular spectrum is not systematically driven by the precision structure of v₀\. Most modes probe a mixture of high\- and low\-precision dimensions\.

# __3\. Frequency Content of Encoder Rows and Columns__

## __3\.1 Row Frequency Analysis__

Each row of W defines a linear functional f ↦ wᵀ\_d f, mapping the 128\-dim feature vector to a single encoder dimension\. Treating f as a 128\-point discrete signal \(indexed by position in the feature vector\), the DFT of each row reveals which “input patterns” that encoder dimension responds to\. A row concentrated at low frequencies responds to slowly\-varying patterns \(DC, trends\); a high\-frequency row responds to rapid oscillations in the feature index\.

__Key result__

__Encoder rows concentrate power in the mid\-to\-high frequency band \(CoM ≈ 31/64\)\. __The mean centre\-of\-mass of the row frequency content is 30\.98 \(out of 63\), with 64\.8% of rows mid\-dominated \(CoM 8–31\) and 35\.2% high\-dominated \(CoM ≥32\)\. Zero rows are low\-frequency dominated \(CoM < 8\)\. The mean power fractions are: LF = 0\.135, MF = 0\.369, HF = 0\.496\. The encoder is predominantly a mid\-to\-high\-frequency filter in the feature index domain — it suppresses slowly\-varying patterns and emphasises rapidly oscillating index patterns\.

__Both row and column frequency distributions are centred near the Nyquist midpoint\. __Row CoM: mean 31\.0, std 2\.3, range \[24, 36\]\. Column CoM: mean 31\.6, std 2\.4\. The narrow standard deviation \(2\.3–2\.4\) indicates that all rows have similar frequency content — the encoder does not specialise different output dimensions for different frequency bands\. This uniform distribution is consistent with the near\-flat singular spectrum: the encoder is an “omnidirectional” filter without strong frequency selectivity\.

## __3\.2 Input–Output Transfer Function__

The effective transfer function of the parser\+encoder pipeline is the frequency\-dependent gain G\(f\) = |FFT\(h\)|² / |FFT\(input\_bytes\)|², measuring how much each frequency component of the raw input is amplified or attenuated by the pipeline\.

__Frequency band__

__The pipeline is a strong high\-pass filter \(gain ratio 44\.3× high vs low\)\.__

The 44\.3× ratio of high\-to\-low frequency gain is a direct consequence of the StructuralParser’s position\-encoding scheme\. The parser maps input bytes to a 128\-dim feature vector via position\-indexed functions \(e\.g\., position × byte value, modular arithmetic over position\)\. These position encodings suppress the DC component \(constant offset\) and emphasise positional patterns that vary rapidly along the feature index\. The encoder W, trained to separate classes, then further amplifies these high\-frequency positional features because they carry more class\-discriminative information than the low\-frequency \(slowly\-varying\) components\.

__Peak gain varies by class\. __net\_scan peaks at f=41 \(G=2\.1×10⁻²\), log\_warn peaks at f=35 \(G=4\.3×10⁻², the largest peak gain overall\), and bin\_malware peaks at f=44 \(G=8\.3×10⁻⁴\)\. Binary classes have the lowest peak gains — consistent with their random payload bytes providing broadband input signal power that distributes across all output frequencies without concentrating at any peak\.

# __4\. Gram Matrix Spectral Analysis__

## __4\.1 Global Gram Matrix__

The Gram matrix G = \(1/D\) H Hᵀ, where H ∈ ℝ^\{1000×128\} is the matrix of all encoder outputs, characterises the effective kernel of the encoder: G\_\{ij\} = ⟨h\_i, h\_j⟩/D measures the inner\-product similarity between all 1,000 encoded samples\. Its eigenspectrum reveals the intrinsic dimensionality of the encoder’s output\.

__Effective dimension = 1\.24 with spectral gap 0\.960\.__

__The Gram matrix is dominated by a single eigenvalue \(λ₁ = 103\.7\) capturing 89\.7% of variance, with a gap of \(λ₁−λ₂\)/λ₁ = 0\.960\. __This reflects the fact that all 1,000 encoder outputs, across all 10 classes, share a common large\-magnitude component — the norm of each h is O\(10\) — while the inter\-class structure \(the components that distinguish classes\) is captured by the remaining eigenvalues \(λ₂ through λ₅, sum ≈7%\)\. The effective dimension of 1\.24 means the 1,000\-point encoder output distribution is essentially 1\-dimensional at the global scale, with weak multi\-class structure on top of the dominant radius component\.

__Per\-class Gram matrices are rank\-1 to within 1\.5×10⁻²\. __The effective rank of 1\.00–1\.06 for all classes means that each class’s 100 encoder outputs are nearly collinear — they all point in the same direction in ℝ^\{128\} up to a scalar amplitude\. This is the harmonic manifestation of the tight within\-class distributions found in the persistent homology analysis: the log classes have exactly rank\-1 Gram matrices \(λ₁/Σλ = 1\.000\), while binary classes have slightly higher rank \(eff\_rank ≈1\.05–1\.06\) due to their random payload bytes introducing weak orthogonal variance\.

# __5\. Power Spectral Density of Encoder Outputs__

## __5\.1 Per\-Class PSD__

Treating the 100 encoder outputs per class as a multivariate time series H\_k ∈ ℝ^\{100×128\} \(100 samples × 128 dimensions\), the power spectral density is computed along the sample dimension \(axis 0\), then averaged over the 128 encoder dimensions\.

__Mean spectral flatness = 0\.843: encoder output sequences are near\-white\. __The spectral flatness of 0\.843 \(maximum = 1\.0 for pure white noise\) indicates that the encoder output variations across samples are broadly distributed in frequency with no strongly dominant periodicity\. The binary classes \(bin\_malware, bin\_benign\) have the flattest spectra \(0\.959–0\.963\), consistent with their random payload bytes producing i\.i\.d\. encoder outputs\. The network classes \(net\_ddos flatness 0\.670, net\_scan 0\.765\) have the most structured PSDs, reflecting the structured numerical variation in their inputs \(packet rates, port numbers\)\.

__All 45 pairs of class spectral fingerprints have cosine similarity ≥0\.9999\.__

The frequency fingerprint \(mean PSD vector over 50 one\-sided frequencies\) is identical across all 10 classes\. This is not merely high similarity — it is numerical identity to 4 decimal places\. The encoder maps all traffic classes to the same power distribution over sample\-index frequency, regardless of class\. This confirms that the encoder’s frequency response is class\-invariant: it does not selectively amplify different frequency components for different classes\. The class\-discriminative information is encoded in the DC component \(the mean h value per class, i\.e\., the centroid μ\_k\) rather than in any frequency structure\.

# __6\. Harmonic Content of Class Offset Vectors__

## __6\.1 FFT of δ\_k Vectors__

Each class offset vector δ\_k ∈ ℝ^\{128\} \(the learned deviation of class k from the world prior in latent space\) is a 128\-point discrete signal indexed by encoder dimension d = 0, …, 127\. The DFT of δ\_k reveals whether the class offset is a “smooth” pattern \(low\-frequency\) or “oscillatory” \(high\-frequency\) in the dimension index\.

__net\_ddos and net\_c2 have the highest DC amplitude \(2\.41, 1\.91\)\. __A large DC component in FFT\(δ\_k\) means the class offset has a large constant bias across all 128 dimensions — the class centroid μ\_k is uniformly shifted from μ₀ in all directions\. This is consistent with the network traffic classes \(which have consistent structural patterns such as fixed payload rates or beacon URIs\) learning a globally offset representation\.

__bin\_malware has the highest total power \(2\.523\) and low peak frequency \(f=8\)\. __The large total power of bin\_malware’s offset spectrum reflects its large ||delta\_k||\_V = 11\.53 \(the largest precision\-weighted offset\)\. The peak at f=8 \(relatively low frequency\) suggests the malware class offset has a structured, slowly\-varying pattern in dimension index space rather than the high\-frequency oscillation seen in other classes\. This may reflect the parser’s position\-encoding scheme amplifying certain byte\-position patterns in MZ headers\.

__Pairwise harmonic similarity averages 0\.799 \(range 0\.706–0\.910\)\. __The class offset spectra are moderately similar: the pairwise cosine similarity of |FFT\(δ\_i\)| and |FFT\(δ\_j\)| ranges from 0\.706 \(net\_ddos↔bin\_benign\) to 0\.910 \(bin\_malware↔bin\_benign\)\. The binary classes are harmonically the most similar pair \(0\.910\), reflecting their common byte\-array structure\. net\_ddos and bin\_benign are the most harmonically distinct \(0\.706\), reflecting fundamentally different input types \(structured network floods vs\. random ELF content\)\.

The 9\.1× dynamic range \(\[0\.0048, 0\.0439\]\) is real variation in per\-dimension precision but is not organised in a periodic pattern\.

# __8\. Graph Fourier Transform on the Centroid Graph__

## __8\.1 Graph Laplacian__

We define a weighted graph on K=10 class centroids with edge weights A\_\{ij\} = exp\(−||μ\_i−μ\_j||²/\(2σ²\)\) \(Gaussian kernel, σ² = median squared distance\)\. The graph Laplacian L = D − A encodes the centroid graph’s connectivity structure\. Its eigenvectors form a basis for signals on the class graph \(the graph Fourier basis\)\.

__Fiedler value λ₁ = 4\.845: high algebraic connectivity\.__

The Fiedler value \(second\-smallest Laplacian eigenvalue\) measures how well\-connected the graph is\. λ₁ = 4\.845 is large, reflecting the dense weighting of the Gaussian kernel on a set of 10 centroids with relatively uniform inter\-centroid distances \(all pairwise distances in \[1\.06, 1\.67\]\)\. The graph is approximately a complete weighted graph with no bottlenecks or cluster cuts — consistent with the topological analysis showing a single connected component with a narrow merge\-scale range\.

The Fiedler vector \(eigenvector corresponding to λ₁\) shows a dominant negative loading on bin\_malware \(−0\.903\) with small positive loadings on all other classes\. This indicates bin\_malware is the class most “different” from the remaining centroid cluster, consistent with its being the last class to merge in the dendrogram \(Section 3 of the persistent homology paper\) and having the largest ||delta\_k||\_V\.

## __8\.2 Graph Fourier Transform of LLR Signal__

We define a scalar signal on the centroid graph: s\_k = LLR\_k\(μ\_k\) \(the self\-LLR of each class evaluated at its own centroid\)\. The graph Fourier transform \(GFT\) ŝ = Uᵀ s decomposes this signal into the graph eigenbasis\.

This is expected: the self\-LLR of class k is proportional to ||δ\_k||²\_V/2, the precision\-weighted squared norm of the class offset\. Since adjacent classes tend to have similar offset magnitudes, the LLR signal is smooth on the graph\.

__Total variation TV = 12,163 confirms moderate graph smoothness\. __The total variation TV = ŝᵀ Λ ŝ measures the energy in the AC components weighted by their frequency\. TV = 12,163 is large in absolute terms \(dominated by the large LLR magnitudes\) but small relative to the DC power \(18,896\): the ratio TV/||ŝ||² = 12,163/20,871 = 0\.583\. A perfectly smooth signal would have TV = 0; a maximally rough signal \(anti\-correlated on all edges\) would have TV ≈ 7\.17 × 20,871 ≈ 150,000\. The LLR signal sits at 0\.583/7\.17 ≈ 8% of maximum roughness — smooth but not trivially so\.

# __9\. Spectral Analysis of LLR Sequences__

For each class k, the sequence of self\-LLRs LLR\_k\(h\_n\) for n=1, …, 100 \(ordered training samples\) is a scalar time series\. Its PSD reveals whether LLR values vary randomly across samples \(flat spectrum\) or with systematic periodic structure\.

The rigid \[TYPE\] HH:MM:SS format produces near\-identical encoder outputs for all log samples, resulting in a near\-constant LLR sequence with negligible AC components\. This is the spectral signature of the tight within\-class distributions found in both the statistical analysis and persistent homology papers\.

__net\_ddos has the lowest spectral flatness \(0\.570\) and highest AC structure\. __The packet\-count range \(500–500,000\) in net\_ddos generates the largest within\-class variation in numerical features, producing an LLR sequence that is the most structured \(least flat\) among all classes\. The dominant AC frequency at bin 5 \(period ≈20 samples\) may reflect a quasi\-periodic pattern in how the random packet counts interact with the parser’s position encoding\.

# __10\. Synthesis__

- __The encoder is a near\-white, high\-rank linear filter \(κ=13\.27, eff\_rank=113\.8, flatness=0\.965\)\. __No small subset of encoder modes dominates; information is spread across all 128 dimensions\. The mild 1/f⁰·² spectral decay is a common property of learned representations and is far from the strongly correlated spectra of structured signals\.
- __The encoder is a high\-pass filter in the feature index domain \(gain ratio 44\.3×\)\. __The parser\+encoder pipeline strongly suppresses DC and low\-frequency patterns in the feature index, amplifying mid\-to\-high frequency positional patterns\. This is the spectral signature of position\-encoded feature extraction: slowly\-varying byte patterns \(globally uniform bytes\) are suppressed in favour of rapidly\-varying positional structure\.
- __All encoder output sequences have identical spectral fingerprints \(cosine sim ≥0\.9999\)\. __The encoder’s frequency response is class\-invariant\. Class\-discriminative information is encoded in the mean latent vector \(centroid\) rather than in any frequency\-domain feature\. The classifier is “DC\-coded” in the sample\-sequence domain\.
- __The Gram matrix has effective dimension 1\.24 globally \(rank\-1 per class\)\. __The 89\.7% dominance of the first Gram eigenvalue confirms that all 1,000 encoder outputs share a common large\-magnitude direction \(the norm component\), with class structure captured by the remaining 10\.3%\. Per\-class Gram matrices are rank\-1 to within 1\.5×10⁻², with log classes exactly rank\-1\.
- __The self\-LLR signal on the centroid graph is 90\.4% DC \(smooth\)\. __LLR values vary smoothly over the centroid graph: geometrically adjacent classes have similar self\-LLR values\. The Fiedler value 4\.845 confirms a well\-connected centroid graph with no bottlenecks or cluster cuts\.
- __Log classes have LLR SNR up to 7\.5×10⁶; binary classes have SNR ≈1,400–1,800\. __The spectral analysis quantifies the within\-class LLR consistency: log classes produce near\-constant LLR sequences while binary classes produce moderately variable ones\. This 3\-order\-of\-magnitude SNR gap directly reflects the 3\-order\-of\-magnitude difference in within\-class variance \(tight logs vs\. diffuse binaries\)\.

# __11\. Conclusion__

The harmonic analysis reveals a consistent spectral picture of CyphaDIF: the encoder is a near\-white, high\-pass, high\-rank linear filter that maps structured traffic inputs to near\-collinear class representations \(rank\-1 per\-class Gram matrices\) with class\-invariant frequency fingerprints\. The class\-discriminative information is encoded entirely in the mean latent vector \(centroid\), not in any frequency\-domain variation\. The LLR signal is smooth on the centroid graph \(90\.4% DC\), confirming that the classifier’s confidence structure is a slowly\-varying function of class geometry\. The large Fiedler value \(4\.845\) confirms a well\-connected, bottleneck\-free centroid graph\.
