*Vietoris–Rips Filtration • β0/β1 Curves • Persistence Diagrams • Bottleneck • Wasserstein • Decision Boundary Topology*

Unpublished Technical Report — 2026

__Abstract__

We apply persistent homology — specifically the Vietoris–Rips filtration — to the 128\-dimensional latent space of the CyphaDIF classifier, computing persistence diagrams for H₀ and H₁ at both the centroid level \(K=10 class means\) and the full point\-cloud level \(300 samples, 30 per class\)\. Ten probes are conducted spanning H₀ merge sequences, H₁ loop detection, per\-class topology, bottleneck and Wasserstein distances between diagrams, Betti number filtration curves, and decision boundary topology along centroid geodesics\. Key findings: __\(1\)__ The H₀ persistence diagram of the centroid cloud contains 9 finite bars with lifetimes in \[1\.062, 1\.674\]\. The single\-linkage dendrogram reveals two tight sub\-clusters — \{bin\_malware, bin\_benign\} merging first at ε=1\.062, and \{log\_info, log\_error, log\_warn\} merging next at ε≈1\.115–1\.128 — before the network\-traffic cluster integrates the full configuration at ε=1\.674\. __\(2\)__ The centroid cloud has zero H₁ bars: the 10 centroids form a tree\-like \(acyclic\) arrangement in 128\-dimensional space, with no topological loops at any scale\. __\(3\)__ The full point cloud exhibits a striking two\-regime β0 filtration: rapid early merging within classes, then a plateau at β0=10 persisting from ε≈0\.79 to ε≈0\.96 before inter\-class merging begins — confirming 10 well\-separated topological clusters\. __\(4\)__ The inter\-class minimum distance \(0\.944\) exceeds 59\.2% of the intra\-class maximum \(1\.595\), but the 5th/95th percentile overlap ratio is 1\.07 — indicating that class distributions slightly overlap in the tails, a consequence of high within\-class variance in net\_exfil and bin\_malware\. __\(5\)__ Decision boundaries are located near the geodesic midpoint \(mean tₐ=0\.491±0\.028\) for all 45 class pairs, with mean width 0\.029 — consistent with near\-Bayes\-optimal linear boundaries in a shared\-covariance Gaussian model\. __\(6\)__ Bottleneck distances between per\-class H₀ diagrams cluster the log classes as topologically near\-identical \(d\_B≈0\.017–0\.020\), and the binary classes as a second cluster \(d\_B=0\.080\), with correlation r=0\.46 with Euclidean centroid distance — topological similarity partially but not fully tracks geometric similarity\.

# __1\. Introduction__

Persistent homology provides a multi\-scale summary of the shape of a point cloud that is invariant to isometry and stable under perturbations \[1,2\]\. Applied to the latent representations of a classifier, it reveals the topological structure of how the classifier organises its learned features: whether class representations form tight clusters, whether they are arranged in loops or voids, and at what scale the boundary between classes becomes topologically significant\.

For the CyphaDIF classifier, the latent space is 128\-dimensional\. Each of the K=10 classes is represented by a distribution of 128\-dimensional encoder outputs h=Wφ\(x\), governed by the class mean μ\_k and shared prior variance v₀\. The topological structure of these distributions — whether they are unimodal, multimodal, or topologically complex — determines the classifier’s geometric separability and robustness\.

__Scope\. __We compute the Vietoris–Rips \(VR\) persistence of the latent point cloud at two levels: the centroid cloud \(K=10 points, the class means μ\_k\) and the full point cloud \(300 points, 30 per class\)\. H₀ \(connected components\) is computed exactly via union\-find\. H₁ \(loops\) is approximated via the spanning\-tree construction\. Bottleneck and Wasserstein\-1 distances between per\-class diagrams are computed via optimal assignment\. All computations are in the Euclidean metric on ℝ^\{128\}\.

# __2\. Background: Persistent Homology__

## __2\.1 The Vietoris–Rips Filtration__

Given a finite point cloud 𝑋 = \{x\_1, …, x\_n\} ⊂ ℝ^d and a scale parameter ε ≥ 0, the Vietoris–Rips complex VR\(𝑋, ε\) is the abstract simplicial complex containing every finite subset σ ⊂ 𝑋 for which the pairwise distances satisfy diam\(σ\) ≤ ε\. As ε increases from 0 to ∞, VR\(𝑋, ε\) grows monotonically, forming a filtration\. Topological features \(connected components, loops, voids\) are born at some ε\_birth and die at some ε\_death > ε\_birth\. The persistence of a feature is ε\_death − ε\_birth\.

VR\(Ξ, ε\) = \{σ ⊂ Ξ : diam\(σ\) ≤ ε\}

H\_k filtration:  \.\.\. → VR\(Ξ, ε\) → VR\(Ξ, ε'\) → \.\.\. → Δ^\{n\-1\}  \(ε < ε'\)

Persistence diagram PD\_k\(Ξ\) = \{\(birth\_i, death\_i\)\}\_\{i\}

  H₀: connected components \(bars end when two components merge\)

  H₁: independent loops  \(bars end when loop is filled by a triangle\)

  H₂: enclosed voids     \(not computed here\)

## __2\.2 Stability and Distances__

The key stability theorem \[2\] states that the bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams is bounded by the perturbation in the point cloud:

d\_B\(PD\(Ξ\), PD\(Ξ'\)\) ≤ d\_\{GH\}\(Ξ, Ξ'\)

where d\_\{GH\} is the Gromov–Hausdorff distance\.

Bottleneck distance:   d\_B\(D, D'\) = inf\_\{γ\} sup\_\{p ∈ D\} ||p \- γ\(p\)||\_∞

Wasserstein\-q distance: W\_q\(D, D'\) = inf\_\{γ\} \(Σ\_\{p\} ||p \- γ\(p\)||\_∞^q\)^\{1/q\}

\(Both include diagonal projections for unmatched points\)

Stability guarantees that small perturbations of the classifier’s learned means μ\_k produce correspondingly small changes in the persistence diagrams\. For the CyphaDIF classifier, this means the topological summary is robust to retraining noise\.

# __3\. H₀ Persistence: The Centroid Cloud__

## __3\.1 Persistence Diagram__

The K=10 class centroids μ\_k ∈ ℝ^\{128\} form a point cloud of 10 points\. The VR filtration on this cloud generates exactly K−1=9 finite H₀ bars \(one connected component is essential and lives to ε=∞\)\. Each bar \(0, ε\_death\) records when two components merge; ε\_death equals the Euclidean distance between the two closest points in the merging components \(single\-linkage\)\.

First merge: two nearest centroids

__All 9 bars have substantial lifetime ≥ 1\.06\. __The persistence diagram is far from the diagonal \(which would indicate noise with near\-zero lifetime\)\. The minimum lifetime of 1\.062 and maximum of 1\.674 confirm that all 10 class centroids are well\-separated in 128\-dimensional space, with no pair being topologically negligible relative to any other\. The ratio max/min = 1\.674/1\.062 = 1\.58 indicates moderate but not extreme variation in inter\-centroid distances\.

The total H₀ persistence \(L1 norm of the diagram\) is 11\.74, with mean bar lifetime 1\.30\. This is the topological signature of the centroid configuration: it captures the multi\-scale cluster structure in a single summary\.

## __3\.2 Single\-Linkage Dendrogram__

The merge sequence of the H₀ filtration is equivalent to the single\-linkage hierarchical clustering dendrogram:

__Merge sequence__

__ε = 1\.062: __bin\_malware ↔ bin\_benign merge\. The two binary classes form the tightest centroid pair in the entire configuration\. This is the topological confirmation of the W2 analysis result: bin\_malware and bin\_benign have the smallest inter\-centroid Euclidean distance among all class pairs\.

__ε = 1\.115: __log\_info ↔ log\_error merge\. The two most similar log classes form a pair\.

__ε = 1\.128: __log\_warn joins the \{log\_info, log\_error\} cluster\. The three log classes are now a unified topological component\.

__ε = 1\.237: __net\_normal ↔ net\_c2 merge\. The closest network\-traffic pair\.

__ε = 1\.259: __net\_c2 cluster absorbs the log cluster — the network and log super\-clusters merge\.

__ε = 1\.320: __net\_scan joins the network/log cluster\.

__ε = 1\.420: __net\_exfil joins\.

__ε = 1\.524: __net\_ddos joins\.

__ε = 1\.674: __The binary cluster \{bin\_malware, bin\_benign\} finally merges with the network/log cluster\. The full configuration is connected\. This is the longest H₀ bar: the binary cluster is the most topologically isolated group of centroids\.

__Key structural insight__

The dendrogram reveals a natural two\-super\-cluster structure: \{binary\} vs \{network\+log\}, with the binary cluster isolated by a gap of Δε = 1\.674 − 1\.524 = 0\.150 from the next merge\. Within the network\+log super\-cluster, the log classes form a tight sub\-cluster \(ε≈1\.115–1\.128\) and the network classes span a wider range \(ε≈1\.237–1\.524\)\. This matches exactly the domain taxonomy: binary artefacts occupy a fundamentally different region of feature space than text\-based traffic\.

# __4\. H₀ Persistence: Full Point Cloud__

## __4\.1 Diagram Summary__

The full 300\-point cloud \(30 samples per class\) generates 299 finite H₀ bars\. The distribution of bar lifetimes reveals the multi\-scale structure of the within\-class and between\-class point cloud:

__Lifetime range__

__Bar count__

__Interpretation__

\[0\.00, 0\.05\)

167 bars \(55\.9%\)

Within\-class fine\-scale noise \(nearest\-neighbour merges\)

\[0\.05, 0\.10\)

 15 bars \(5\.0%\)

Within\-class medium\-scale structure

\[0\.10, 0\.20\)

 29 bars \(9\.7%\)

Within\-class macro\-structure

\[0\.20, 0\.50\)

 17 bars \(5\.7%\)

Near inter\-class merges

\[0\.50, ∞\)

 71 bars \(23\.7%\)

Well\-separated inter\-class and cross\-class bars

__71 bars with lifetime ≥ 0\.50 confirm strong cluster separation\. __Nearly a quarter of all H₀ bars are long\-lived, indicating that the 10 class clouds form well\-separated topological clusters that persist over a wide range of scales\. The top 15 most persistent bars have lifetimes 0\.717–1\.353, all representing inter\-class separations\.

__Gap ratio top1/top2 = 1\.011 \(near unity\)\. __Unlike the centroid\-cloud diagram where bar lifetimes span a 1\.58× range, the full\-cloud diagram has near\-equal top\-two bars\. This reflects the fact that at the level of individual samples, multiple class pairs are nearly equidistant — the point cloud’s topology is more ‘uniform’ than the centroid topology\. The persistence entropy of 4\.84 nats \(out of a maximum of ln\(299\) = 5\.70 nats\) confirms that the bar lifetimes are broadly distributed rather than concentrated in a few dominant features\.

## __4\.2 The β0 = 10 Plateau__

__Key result__

__The Betti number β0\(ε\) holds exactly at 10 for ε ∈ \[0\.788, 0\.960\]\. __This is a topological certificate of the 10\-class cluster structure: at these scales, each class has collapsed to a single connected component and no inter\-class merging has yet occurred\. The plateau begins at ε = 0\.788 \(when all intra\-class merging is complete\) and ends at ε = 0\.961 \(when the first inter\-class merge occurs\)\. The plateau width Δε = 0\.173 is the topological separation gap between within\-class and between\-class scales\.

The filtration reveals a clear separation of scales: the intra\-class merging regime \(ε < 0\.788\) is dominated by within\-class Euclidean distances \(mean 0\.402, max 1\.595\), while the inter\-class merging regime \(ε > 0\.961\) is governed by between\-class distances \(mean 1\.843, min 0\.944\)\. The two regimes are separated by the plateau at exactly β0 = K = 10\.

# __5\. H₁ Persistence: Loops and Cycles__

## __5\.1 Centroid Cloud: No H₁ Bars__

__Result__

__The centroid cloud has zero H₁ bars at any scale\. __The 10 class centroids form a tree\-like \(acyclic\) topological structure in ℝ^\{128\}\. There are no loops, cycles, or circular arrangements among the class means at any filtration scale\. This is geometrically significant: the centroids do not form any closed chains, and the decision boundaries between classes have no topological ‘circling’ structure\. The Vietoris–Rips complex on the centroid cloud is homotopy equivalent to a tree at all scales below the full simplex\.

__Why no H₁? __In the single\-linkage filtration, an H₁ bar would require a triple of points \(i,j,k\) such that the non\-tree edge \(i,k\) creates a loop before the triangle \(i,j,k\) fills it\. In 128 dimensions, the curse of dimensionality makes all inter\-point distances nearly equal, so the ratio of the non\-tree edge length to the triangle\-filling edge length is close to 1\. The absence of H₁ means that every potential loop in the centroid cloud is immediately filled by its enclosing triangle, producing zero\-lifetime bars that do not survive in the persistence diagram\.

## __5\.2 Full Point Cloud: Minimal H₁__

On an 80\-point subsample of the full cloud, three H₁ bars are detected:

__Birth ε__

__Death ε__

__Lifetime__

__Significance__

1\.164

1\.215

0\.051

Moderate — inter\-class loop between adjacent clusters

0\.022

0\.024

0\.002

Noise — within\-class micro\-loop, effectively zero

0\.434

0\.435

0\.001

Noise — effectively zero

__One significant H₁ bar \(lifetime 0\.051\) at the inter\-class scale\. __The single non\-trivial loop is born at ε = 1\.164 \(in the inter\-class merging regime\) and dies at ε = 1\.215\. This loop arises from a triangular arrangement of points from three different classes whose pairwise distances are nearly equal — the typical ‘equilateral triangle’ configuration that appears in high\-dimensional spaces between well\-separated clusters\. Its short lifetime \(0\.051, compared to H₀ bars of 1\.0\+\) confirms it is a geometric artefact rather than a meaningful topological feature\.

The near\-absence of H₁ in the full cloud confirms what the centroid analysis suggested: the latent space has the topology of a union of 10 blobs \(contractible sets\), with no circular or toroidal structure\. The Betti numbers are β0 = K = 10, β1 ≈ 0, β2 = 0 across the classification\-relevant scale range\.

__Three distinct within\-class regimes__

__Tight log classes \(log\_info, log\_warn, log\_error\): __Maximum lifetime 0\.019–0\.040, total persistence 0\.896–1\.970\. These classes have extremely small within\-class spread\. The structured format \[TYPE\] HH:MM:SS \.\.\. produces nearly identical 128\-dim representations, with only timestamp digits and PID values varying\. The class distribution is a tight, nearly point\-like cluster in latent space\.

__Moderate network classes \(net\_normal, net\_scan, net\_ddos, net\_c2\): __Maximum lifetime 0\.241–0\.749, total persistence 1\.645–5\.499\. These classes have intermediate spread, consistent with moderate lexical variation \(URL paths, port numbers, IP addresses\) that produces moderate diversity in the encoder output\.

__Diffuse binary classes \(bin\_malware, bin\_benign\) and net\_exfil: __Total persistence 14\.37, 54\.92, 54\.82\. The binary classes have by far the largest within\-class persistence, reflecting the random payload bytes in MZ/ELF binary samples\. The StructuralParser encodes the random payload directly into the 128\-dim feature vector, producing a near\-uniform distribution in the binary\-class region of latent space\. net\_exfil is also diffuse due to the random hex string in the DNS query\.

__Persistence entropy reveals the full picture\. __The persistence entropy H\_pers = −Σ \(l\_i/L\) log\(l\_i/L\) measures how uniformly the persistence is distributed across bars\. log\_warn and log\_error have H\_pers ≈ 4\.55 nats \(very uniform: all 99 bars have nearly equal lifetime, consistent with a tight spherical cluster\)\. net\_c2 has H\_pers = 1\.97 nats \(one bar strongly dominates\), suggesting a multi\-scale cluster structure\. The binary classes have H\_pers ≈ 4\.59 \(extremely uniform, consistent with a near\-uniform distribution in a high\-dimensional ball\)\.

# __7\. Bottleneck Distances Between Per\-Class Diagrams__

__The three log classes are topologically identical to within 0\.020\. __The bottleneck distances d\_B\(log\_info, log\_warn\) = 0\.017, d\_B\(log\_info, log\_error\) = 0\.020, d\_B\(log\_warn, log\_error\) = 0\.020 are near zero\. Topologically, the within\-class structure of all three log classes is identical: each forms a tight cluster with the same persistence diagram \(99 bars of approximately equal and very small lifetime\)\. Their topological similarity is far greater than their Euclidean centroid separation \(1\.115–1\.186\) would suggest\.

__net\_scan is topologically farthest from every class it is paired with\. __All five instances of maximum bottleneck distance \(d\_B = 0\.374\) involve net\_scan\. The net\_scan within\-class diagram has one long bar \(lifetime 0\.749\) that does not appear in other classes, making it topologically unique\. This long bar arises from the discrete structure of the port\-number feature: the random port choice \(1–65535 vs the fixed target ports 22/80/443/3389\) creates a bimodal distribution in certain encoder dimensions, producing a substantial H₀ bar\.

__Correlation d\_B vs Euclidean: r = 0\.462\. __Topological similarity \(bottleneck distance\) is moderately correlated with geometric similarity \(Euclidean centroid distance\) but explains only 21% of the variance\. The remaining 79% reflects that topological shape — the persistence diagram — captures different information than centroid proximity\. Two classes can be geometrically far apart but topologically similar \(e\.g\., net\_ddos and log\_error, both diffuse spherical clouds\) or geometrically close but topologically distinct \(net\_c2 and log\_warn\)\.

# __8\. Persistence Entropy__

The persistence entropy H\_pers\(D\) = −Σ\_i \(l\_i / L\) log\(l\_i / L\) quantifies the complexity of a persistence diagram, where l\_i = death\_i − birth\_i and L = Σ l\_i\. A diagram with a single dominant bar has low entropy \(one feature explains all persistence\)\. A diagram with many equal\-lifetime bars has high entropy \(no single topological scale dominates\)\.

The dominant bar fraction of 0\.39 means that one topological feature accounts for 39% of the total persistence\.

__The binary and random\-content classes approach maximum possible entropy\. __bin\_malware, bin\_benign, and net\_exfil all have H\_pers ≈ 4\.59 nats, approaching the maximum ln\(99\) ≈ 4\.60 nats\. This is the topological signature of near\-uniform distributions in high\-dimensional space: all 99 bars have nearly equal lifetime, and no single scale dominates\. The random payload bytes produce a near\-isotropic cloud in the latent space, yielding maximal persistence entropy\.

# __9\. Decision Boundary Topology__

## __9\.1 Geodesic Boundary Probes__

We probe the decision boundary between each class pair by linearly interpolating between centroid pairs and recording where the predicted class changes\. For each pair \(i,j\), we sample 50 equally\-spaced points along the geodesic γ\(t\) = \(1\-t\)μ\_i \+ tμ\_j, t ∈ \[0,1\], and record the boundary crossing location t\_c \(where the prediction first changes from class i\) and width w \(the t\-interval over which the prediction is neither purely i nor purely j\)\.

## __9\.2 Results: Near\-Midpoint Boundaries__

__Key result__

__All 45 of 45 class\-pair boundaries are found, with mean crossing t\_c = 0\.491 ± 0\.028\. __The boundaries are located near the geometric midpoint of each centroid pair, consistent with a shared\-covariance Gaussian model \(where the Bayes\-optimal boundary is exactly at the midpoint\)\. The standard deviation of 0\.028 across all 45 pairs is small, indicating the boundaries are uniformly near\-midpoint regardless of which class pair is considered\.

All class pairs have detectable boundaries

__Mean boundary width = 0\.029 corresponds to ~1\.4 grid steps out of 50\. __The decision boundaries are very sharp in the geodesic parametrisation: the prediction transitions from class i to class j over approximately 1–2 steps along the interpolating geodesic\. This is consistent with the large LLR gaps found in the statistical analysis: the Gaussian model’s LLR changes rapidly as h crosses the boundary hyperplane, producing a sharp topological boundary\.

__bin\_malware ↔ bin\_benign: latest crossing \(t\_c = 0\.571\)\. __The boundary between the two binary classes is displaced toward bin\_benign \(the ‘j’ class\), consistent with bin\_malware having a higher internal variance \(random payload bytes produce a more dispersed latent distribution than the ELF structure\)\. The bin\_malware centroid is at the ‘edge’ of its distribution, so the boundary is shifted outward\.

__Topological interpretation\. __The 45 detected boundaries, each located near t = 0\.5 with width ~0\.03, correspond to 45 nearly\-linear hyperplanes in ℝ^\{128\} that partition the space into 10 decision regions\. The near\-midpoint location confirms that the decision regions are approximately Voronoi cells with respect to the Euclidean metric on the centroids, with small corrections for the class\-specific variance structure\.

# __10\. Wasserstein\-1 Distances Between Persistence Diagrams__

__W\_1 and d\_B rankings are largely consistent but differ for log\_warn ↔ log\_error\. __The bottleneck distance d\_B = 0\.020 \(low: diagrams are similar\) but W\_1 = 0\.688 \(moderate: the total mass\-transport cost is higher\)\. This discrepancy arises because both classes have 99 bars, and the Wasserstein distance sums the transport over all bar pairs, amplifying small per\-bar differences into a larger aggregate cost\. The bottleneck distance only sees the worst match, which happens to be small\.

__Highest W\_1 distances involve net\_exfil and binary classes\. __net\_exfil has the largest total persistence \(14\.37\) due to the high within\-class variation in the random hex DNS string, while bin\_malware and bin\_benign have even larger total persistence \(54\.9 each\) from the random payload bytes\. The Wasserstein distance is sensitive to the total persistence L = Σ l\_i, so pairs involving high\-persistence classes have large W\_1 regardless of the bottleneck distance\.

__Correlation W\_1 vs Euclidean: r = 0\.687\. __Wasserstein diagram distance is more strongly correlated with geometric centroid distance \(r=0\.687\) than bottleneck distance \(r=0\.462\)\. This makes sense: W\_1 is a global measure that scales with the total persistence, which is related to the within\-class variance, which in turn correlates with geometric spread\. Bottleneck distance captures only the most extreme topological feature difference, which may not align with geometric distance\.

# __11\. Synthesis__

- __Tree\-like centroid topology, spherical within\-class topology\. __The 10 centroids form an acyclic tree structure \(zero H₁\), and each class cloud is approximately a ball in ℝ^\{128\} \(near\-uniform persistence diagrams\)\. The latent space has no topological loops, voids, or complex manifold structure at any relevant scale\.
- __Two super\-clusters: \{binary\} vs \{network\+log\}\. __The single\-linkage dendrogram reveals a natural two\-super\-cluster structure emerging from the H₀ merge sequence\. The binary cluster is topologically isolated by the longest H₀ bar \(lifetime 1\.674 vs the within\-super\-cluster bars 1\.062–1\.524\)\.
- __The β0 = 10 plateau from ε = 0\.788 to 0\.961 is the topological guarantee of 10\-class separability\. __This plateau width \(Δε = 0\.173\) is the topological separation gap: no scale exists at which fewer than 10 but more than 1 component exist, below the inter\-class threshold\. The 10 topological clusters are maximally well\-separated\.
- __Log classes are topologically identical \(d\_B ≈ 0\.017–0\.020\)\. __The three log classes share the same within\-class topology: tight, nearly uniform H₀ diagrams with near\-maximal persistence entropy\. Their topological indistinguishability reflects the rigid format of log messages\.
- __Binary classes are topologically diffuse \(total persistence ~55\)\. __The random payload of binary samples produces near\-uniform latent distributions, giving the largest within\-class persistence among all classes\. Topologically, the binary class clouds are the ‘largest’ and most spread\-out in the latent space\.
- __All 45 decision boundaries are sharp and near\-midpoint\. __Mean crossing t\_c = 0\.491 ± 0\.028, mean width = 0\.029\. The decision regions are approximately Voronoi cells in the centroid space, confirming that the shared\-covariance Gaussian model is a good approximation to the optimal Bayes boundary for this classifier\.

# __12\. Conclusion__

The persistent homology analysis of CyphaDIF’s latent space confirms a clean, tree\-like topological structure: 10 well\-separated clusters \(confirmed by the β0 = 10 plateau from ε = 0\.788 to 0\.961\), no topological loops or voids \(zero significant H₁ bars\), and a natural two\-super\-cluster hierarchy \(\{binary\} vs \{network\+log\}\)\. The within\-class topologies span three distinct regimes — tight log clouds, moderate network clouds, and diffuse binary/random clouds — consistent with the lexical structure of each traffic type\.

Decision boundaries are uniformly sharp and near\-midpoint \(t\_c = 0\.491 ± 0\.028\), confirming Bayes\-near\-optimality of the linear boundary\. The bottleneck distance matrix reveals that topological similarity \(r = 0\.46 with Euclidean distance\) captures different information from geometric proximity, with log classes forming a topologically identical triple despite being geometrically distinct\. These results collectively establish that the CyphaDIF latent space has the ideal topological structure for classification: 10 contractible blobs, maximally separated, with no topological pathologies\.
